# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github page. This page contains the repositories from the working of Forschungszentrum Juelich [Civil Safety Research institute](https://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/ias-7/EN/Home/home_node.html) and my own site projects.

## Projects

[JPSeditor](https://github.com/sainho93/jpseditor) is the production repository for [JPSeditor](https://www.jupedsim.org/jpseditor_introduction.html), 
a graphical user interface to create the geometry of a scenario simulated by JuPedSim. I'll push PR for the official repository from here, if you want to contribute JPSeditor project, you should go to the official [repository](https://github.com/JuPedSim/jpseditor) to fork.

[Standard readme](https://github.com/sainho93/standard-readme) is a hacking repository for the [original](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) from me. I'll add some contents for myself.
